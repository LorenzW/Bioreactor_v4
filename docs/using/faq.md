Is the bioreactor rebooting ?
-----------------------------

In case the lower priority process can not be reached during 8s, the bioreactor will restart
automatically. This lower priority process is the one that takes care of blinking the
led.

Using the command `e` you will get the uptime in seconds.

In the of reboot there is also an entry in the log.
